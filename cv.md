## About me

I work at a state-owned enterprise, which is associated with orders of a _defense_ nature. We are engaged in opto-electronic systems and surveillance systems in the *military* industry. I like the work and it is very interesting, but it seems to me that **I have achieved** and learned everything that I wanted in it. I think that I need to grow and therefore I chose the field of information technology, because. **this is the future**. I hope that I will achieve everything that I wished and I will create something **useful and of high quality** for the people and the motherland in the field of digital technologies.
